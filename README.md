### Flight Control Unit
- Based on custom PCB powered from BEC via LDO.
- Controls wing steering servos and main engine with PWM signal going to the ESC.
- Includes USB port for programming with ESD protection, should also handle BEC coexistence.
- Includes SD card and camera. The minimum is to get the ability to take some photos.
