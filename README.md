### Flight Control Unit [FCU]
- The unit is based on custom PCB powered from BEC via LDO.
- Controls wing steering servos and main engine with PWM signal going to the ESC.
- Includes USB port for programming with ESD protection, should also handle BEC coexistence.
- Includes SD card and camera. The minimum is to get the ability to take some photos.

### Electronic Speed Controller [ESC]
- Provides energy for the engine that generates the thrust, making our plane able to fly.
- Provides lower 5V voltage that powers the brain of the plane as well as steering servos, camera and SD card.
